## Installation

Fork this [remote repository](https://github.com/PHeitmann9604/rock-paper-scissors-exercise-1) under your own control, then "clone" or download your remote copy onto your local computer.

Then navigate there from the command line (subsequent commands assume you are running them from the local repository's root directory):

```sh
cd rock-paper-scissors-exercise-1
```
Use Anaconda to create and activate a new virtual environment, perhaps called "my-first-env":

```sh
conda create -n my-first-env python=3.8
conda activate my-first-env
```

After activating the virtual environment, install package dependencies (see the ["requirements.txt"](/requirements.txt) file):

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

After installing the requirements, create a new file titled ".env"

```sh
touch .env
```

After creating the .env folder, create a user name by typing USER_NAME="___" your username should be in the quotes

After creating your username, the game is ready to play - initiate the game through the following command

```sh
python game.py
```

Follow the instructions and enjoy!
